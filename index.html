        Arambha is a permaculture project for the networking of cultures and the synergetic use of resources. We live in an exciting and challenging time in which, as never before, there is the chance to combine old with new knowledge and to
        exchange ideas. Different cultures bring different knowledge from different ages and on this we rely. Arambha means "beginning" and "one" in Sanskrit and serves as a showcase for the transition into a new age. There are only a few places
        in the world where you can find such a variety of plants. How does it sound to you: chestnut trees next to bananas, lemons next to plums or walnuts next to passion fruit? The conscious person longs to supply his body with nutrients, to
        nourish his spirit philosophically and to offer free development for his soul. Our soul path includes the provision and organization of a place of peaceful and open exchange and holistic healing. Regardless of whether you are interested
        in organic farming, sustainable construction, holistic health or alternative education, you have come to the right place. Welcome to Arambha!

                  Anyone who wants to understand the basis of human health must first deal with the nature of agricultural soils. Humans are made up of over 80 minerals, metals and trace elements and in the long term
                  are dependent on consuming them in the form of wholesome foods in order to make progress in life in a fully functioning and healthy manner. With a look at the soil quality of a country, one can draw
                  conclusions and make prognoses about the health of the population.

                  In addition to the minerals, the arrangement of the plants also plays an important role. In a proper mixed culture we find plenty of
                  plants that are not edible for humans. Insects, birds, small animals, bacteria and other microorganisms will benefit of those.
                  If we see the wholeness of life as a "togetherness and for one another", then we understand that part of "our" food belongs to the animals.

                  Finally we invade their areas and claim them for ourselves. Nature gives enough for everyone and as a reminder: Nature does not need
                  humans. Another advantage with a high diversity of plants is the development of the secondary plant substances. In order for a plant to assert itself against others, it has to be strong and it has to
                  protect itself from predators. This is done with secondary plant substances. Many of these substances bring health benefits to people, especially when it comes to preventing desease and maintaining
                  good health. A lot of research is carried out on secondary plant substances in laboratories and yet, due to the large number of plants, very little is known and even less is known about the synergetic
                  effect when combining the active ingredients. Nature rewards diversity and cooperation. When composting, humans bring the soil to life and promote diversity in the microorganisms and thus have an "army"
                  that works for them; similar to the healthy intestinal flora. The more animals are invited on the land, the more they give back as fertilizer in the form of excrement. The great cycle; Everything is connected.

                  In Madeira it is very challenging to deal with the high humidity and to avoid mold growth in buildings above a certain sea level. Thanks to the high pH value of lime, it is preferable to cement. Furthermore, the lime mixture
                  makes the
                  structure
                  able to breath and also keeps many insects away from the interior. Lime was used a time ago to build on the island and the "good" houses were described as "made of lime and stone". In summer the buildings
                  stay fresh thanks to the lime, it feels like air conditioning and in winter wood stoves provide cozy warmth. The walls store the heat and slowly release it again. Due to the round design, the heat stays
                  mainly in the rooms with the stoves and thus ensures a pleasant temperature difference to the bedrooms, where a slightly lower temperature is desired.

                  We see health in the 3 areas of body, mind and soul. These are inextricably linked. We can see our bodies with our eyes and grasp them with our hands, we rely on our sensory perception. In the case of the mind,
                  this becomes more difficult because this takes place via an extrasensorial perception. As children we have the ability to see colors around our bodies and to see ourselves as part of the whole. As soon as "I" and "you" are
                  learned we
                  are already in the
                  perception of a separation. Most people forget to see the colors around the body (aura) because our senses are extremely flooded and overstimulated in the "modern" world. We should be aware that it does not mean that something
                  does not
                  exist because we cannot see it such as radio waves, radiation or love.

                  Rudolf Steiner was of the opinion that there is no such thing as mental illness, since the mind can never be sick. It may very well be that a spirit cannot
                  develop properly in the given body and it's physical conditions. A healthy mind can only live in a healthy body, as the Roman poet Juvenal recognized about 2000 years ago. If people lack nutrients, they are also more susceptible to
                  parasites,
                  which pursue their own goals in the body and thus prevent the mind from developing freely. Parasites can control people emotionally and move them to actions that they would not carry out in a parasite-free state, see
                  Toxoplasma Gondii.
                  In contrast to our physical body, our soul is immortal and strives for experiences in this lowest realm, the physical manifestation. A soul is energy and energy can never be destroyed or created, it can only be transformed.

                  Emotional healing is also about transformation. Every person is only able to process a certain amount of emotions, the rest is held and stored in our emotional body. How many and which emotions we can process differs from
                  person to person.
                  Everyone is individual, has their own story and the ability to deal with traumas. In the course of life we can learn to deal with our emotions and to process them. Regardless of whether we are aware of it or not: the principle
                  that like
                  attracts like works. With burdening emotions we attract more of the same, painful experiences, we accumulate energy in interference fields, strain our organs and complicate our lives by not being able to walk our soul path
                  with joy and
                  without limitations. The connection between organ systems and emotions is pointed out in various traditional teachings of medicine in a wide variety of cultures. The time at which we give these essential things the appropriate
                  importance has come (again). Let us be free from conditioning and the painful stories we tell ourselves about us. If I always do what I already know, I will always be the person I already am. New paths lead to new goals.

                  We live in a time with rapidly changing conditions and what was considered safe for a long time is now at least carries a question mark. Whether real estate, stocks, physical metals, crypto currencies, where the journey is going is
                  not
                  exactly known. It seems like two parallel societies are developing. One strives for progress at all costs, wants to advance technologically as quickly as possible, the other chooses the "magical path" and tries to preserve and
                  improve
                  old knowledge and tradition.
                  Regardless of which of the two directions you belong, both need healthy food. In the foreseeable future, we hardly will be able to avoid eating, which is why the money is well invested here. We are working on increasing the size of
                  the
                  project, technically improving it, protecting species, working with really sustainable building materials, promoting natural energy generation, learning fundamental things for children and finding ways to support people with health
